# RRT-openrave
This repository shows the RRT connect implemented in CPP with a plug in. Openrave works with python, but can be used with C++ using a plug-in. A plug in has been created and the RRT-connect algorithm for motion planning has been implemented with collision check and smoothing. If openrave is installed in your system just running the python code will give you the results. The plug in communicates with python commands to C++ commands to perform functions.
